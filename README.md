# Terra LCD and FCD API

This API is generated from the official Terra swagger docs: https://fcd.terra.dev/swagger

This Swagger spec is a v2.0, and contains a bunch of errors, so conversion to Open API 3.0 is necessary.

The spec is converted using [Apimatic Transformer](https://apimatic.io/transformer), which manages to clean and remove the errors.
